  * (18 Sep 2005) POST fix
  	Now this should work with POST forms as well as GET forms.
  But not multi-part-encoded stuff.  Just POST things which would work
  equally well as GET things, since the way this now works is that if
  a request is a POST request, it gets converted to a GET request,
  since the POST parameters which were in STDIN have already been
  gobbled up; so they get passed to the CGI script by setting the
  environment instead.

  * (10 Jul 2005) explain more limitations
